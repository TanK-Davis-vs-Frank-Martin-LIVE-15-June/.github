Gervonta 'Tank' Davis will look to shake off the ring rust and put a controversial year outside of the ring behind him when he steps back into it to face Frank Martin in his first WBA lightweight title defence, live from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, United States.

The undefeated fighter has not competed since he floored Ryan Garcia in April 2023. Tank instead spent more than a month in jail in Baltimore after breaking a home detention order.

But free to resume his career, Davis now puts his title on the line after he became the WBA's champion following Devin Haney's decision to move divisions and relinquish his crown last November.

It makes his bout with fellow unbeaten competitor Martin a fascinating encounter as he looks to stave off the challenger to his newfound crown in what looks set to be one of the most anticipated bouts of the year.
